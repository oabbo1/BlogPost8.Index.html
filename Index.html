<br /> I go to school at the University of New Haven in West Haven Connecticut. Currently I am a junior Criminal Justice major with a minor in Legal Studies. While here at school I live with my friends Emma and Taiylor in a house a few blocks from campus. I am active in the Phi Simga Sigma sorority, the American Criminal Justice Association, and the Club Field Hockey team. My life here mostly revolves around those clubs, school, and going to coffee shops with my friends. My favorite thing about going to school at UNH is getting to live in New England and getting to explore historical spots and landmarks that it offers. I love taking trips to cities like Boston and New York, going to old battle grounds, and finding places that are supposedly haunted.

<br /> When I am not at school I am home in Portland Oregon where I was born and raised. I love Oregon more than anything and although I live far away it will always be my home. In Oregon I live with my parents and my dog in Northeast Portland, right in the middle of the city. When I am home my life mostly revolves around my family, friends, and spending as much time as possible outdoors. The best part about Oregon is the nature it provides, Portland sits in the valley of Mt. Hood between the Willamette and Columbia rivers and around us is the Pacific coast, mountain ranges, endless lakes and waterfalls, and over the mountain is the dessert. I grew up hiking, backpacking, camping, and kayaking all the time.
